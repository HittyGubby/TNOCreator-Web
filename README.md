*PLANNED TNO customized showcase generator..? By a total frontend noob(

Current Dev Progress: **Refactoring from zero**

- [ ] Arranging Elements.. Basically Just a static website

- [ ] Add Fancy UI or ..? (not quite to my own flavor)

- [ ] Translatable and componentized panel widgets for customization

Well but if you insist to [preview](https://hittygubby.github.io/TNOCreator-Web/) ... 

btw I really HATE separating HTML with CSS, just bringing out so much inconvenience (especially for simple sites like this one)

... so if any of you guys want to refactor due to this, fork and dont send PR...

(technically i can just spam it to random free chatbot... but simply wait for main part to complete first..?)
